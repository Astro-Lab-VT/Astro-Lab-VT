# Welcome to the Advanced Structures and Optimization Lab (AstroLab) at Virginia Tech

At AstroLab, we are interested in computational problems such as **multi-scale modeling**, **optimization**, **uncertainty quantification**, **model reduction**, and **machine learning** for different materials, including **metals**, **metallic alloys**, **composites**, and **meta-materials**. Our work spans multiple length scales, ranging from **micro-scale** to **component-level**, in environments that range from **moderate to extreme** conditions, with a special focus on **design**. 

## Our Areas of Focus:
Our research interests are including (but not limited to) the following topics:

### 1. **Multi-Scale Modeling of Metallic Microstructures:**
We develop computational models to bridge processing-microstructure-properties for metallic microstructures. These models investigate how thermo-mechanical processing variables affect the evolution of microstructures, as well as the development of material properties throughout components. 


### 2. **Microstructure Analysis and Modeling:**
We employ **generative networks** and **image segmentation** to analyze and reconstruct microstructures of **metallic alloys**, enabling a deeper understanding of their behavior under different conditions. This research is critical for advancing **aerospace materials** and optimizing their performance.

# Welcome to the Advanced Structures and Optimization Lab (AstroLab) at Virginia Tech

At AstroLab, we are interested in computational problems such as **multi-scale modeling**, **optimization**, **uncertainty quantification**, **model reduction**, and **machine learning** for different materials, including **metals**, **metallic alloys**, **composites**, and **meta-materials**. Our work spans multiple length scales, ranging from **micro-scale** to **component-level**, in environments that range from **moderate to extreme** conditions, with a special focus on **design**. 

## Our Areas of Focus:
Our research interests are including (but not limited to) the following topics:

### 1. **Multi-Scale Modeling of Metallic Microstructures:**
We develop computational models to bridge processing-microstructure-properties for metallic microstructures. These models investigate how thermo-mechanical processing variables affect the evolution of microstructures, as well as the development of material properties throughout components.

### 2. **Multi-Scale Computational Design of Mechanical Metamaterials:**

We build computational tools to design mechanical metamaterials. We focus on the characterization of non-periodically repeating metamaterial architectures, the development of numerical homogenization methods, building mechanical property spaces, and multi-scale design of metamaterial architectures.

# Welcome to the Advanced Structures and Optimization Lab (AstroLab) at Virginia Tech!

At AstroLab, we are interested in computational problems such as **multi-scale modeling**, **optimization**, **uncertainty quantification**, **model reduction**, and **machine learning** for different materials, including **metals**, **metallic alloys**, **composites**, and **meta-materials**. Our work spans multiple length scales, ranging from **micro-scale** to **component-level**, in environments that range from **moderate to extreme** conditions, with a special focus on **design**. 

## Our Areas of Focus:

### 1. **Quantifying Fabrication-Related Uncertainties:**
We develop and apply advanced **image processing** and **surrogate modeling** techniques to study the uncertainties inherent in manufacturing processes, particularly in **Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS)** lattices. Our goal is to bridge the gap between fabrication methods and their impact on mechanical properties.

### 2. **Microstructure Analysis and Modeling:**
We employ **generative networks** and **image segmentation** to analyze and reconstruct microstructures of **metallic alloys**, enabling a deeper understanding of their behavior under different conditions. This research is critical for advancing **aerospace materials** and optimizing their performance.
